# Forward Difference Method

## Overview
The forward difference method approximates derivatives using points ahead of the target point. It's useful when backward points are not available or reliable.

## Mathematical Foundation

### First Derivative
For the first derivative, we use:
```
f'(x) ≈ [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h
```

### Second Derivative
For the second derivative:
```
f''(x) ≈ [f(x+2h) - 2f(x+h) + f(x)] / h²
```

### Third Derivative
For the third derivative:
```
f'''(x) ≈ [f(x+3h) - 3f(x+2h) + 3f(x+h) - f(x)] / h³
```

## Error Analysis

### Linear Error O(h)
- Basic forward difference formula
- Truncation error is proportional to h

### Quadratic Error O(h²)
- Uses additional forward points
- Improved accuracy through Richardson extrapolation

### Cubic Error O(h³)
- Higher-order forward differences
- Requires more function evaluations

### Quartic Error O(h⁴)
- Maximum accuracy forward scheme
- Uses extended forward stencil

## Advantages
- Only requires function values at x and beyond
- Suitable for boundary value problems
- Good for functions with singularities at x-h

## Disadvantages
- Generally less accurate than central differences
- Can be less stable for some problems
- Requires more points for higher accuracy
